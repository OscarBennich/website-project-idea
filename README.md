# Website project idea
A website to check for "Dagens lunch" (meal-of-the-day) for different restaurants near your location (in Sweden). This would be accomplished mainly through integrating with the Google Maps API.

> Tagline: "Vad blir det till lunch?"

It should be possible to do this using:
- (a) Your current location + a range
- (b) Pick a location on a map + a range
- (c) Maybe choosing like a city from a list?

The results would then be shown in a list, starting with the restaurants that are closest. 

Each item in the list should contain this information:
- The name of the restaurant
- The name and description of "Dagens lunch" (meal-of-the-day)
- Distance (in meters)
- Type of food/cuisine
- A link to the resturant website and/or menu
- Opening hours
- Rating
